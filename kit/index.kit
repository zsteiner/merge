                    <h3>the problem</h3>
                    <p>Administrators of data systems often have to import data files or accept data from third-party systems. Import cuts down manual data entry, but data is really clean or current. This results in conflicts in records. Resolving these conflicts is typically a tedious process of finding and manually fixing conflicts. However, algorithmically merging has considerable risks involved. Typically, resolving conflicts requires a person's approval to ensure data integrity. It's also a relatively risky proposition because most databases join records in a destructive manner. Once the submit button is pressed the records are forever together.</p>

                    <h3>this demo</h3>                      
                    <p>This interface concept demonstrates a method for merging duplicate records when importing data from a file or another data system. In this example, a user imported an Excel file of employee information. There are multiple suspected duplicate employees. Duplicates without differences can be merged at the click of a button or en masse. Those with differences&mdash;maybe "Bob" versus "Robert" or a transposed number in a employee number&mdash;will require walking the user through the merge process, which will be discussed later. The result is a process that helps the user feel comfortable the resulting data is clean by providing feedback and transparency through the process. Despite being a manual process, the interface gives a clear path and empowers the user to quickly make informed decisions. Typical merge operations are destructive, but this method (through hypothetical database) a new version of the employee record linked to the previous two, so that merging/separating can be non-destructive. A user can abandon or undo work as needed through the workflow.</p>
